# Future of Drawing
A workshop on drawing at the [Master Media Design](https://www.hesge.ch/head/en/programs-research/master-arts-media-design), [HEAD – Genève](http://head-geneve.ch) in collaboration with [Caran d'ache](https://www.carandache.com/ch/en).

In this workshop we are prototyping new and intruiging ideas around drawing, drawing tools, writing, and writing tools, in an age of artificial intelligence. This project is the semester project of the [Media Design Master](https://www.hesge.ch/head/en/programs-research/master-arts-media-design) program of the [HEAD – Genève](http://head-geneve.ch).
