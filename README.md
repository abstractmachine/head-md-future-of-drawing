# Future of Drawing
A workshop on drawing at the [Master Media Design](https://www.hesge.ch/head/en/programs-research/master-arts-media-design), [HEAD – Genève](http://head-geneve.ch) in collaboration with [Caran d'ache](https://www.carandache.com/ch/en).

This project is the semester project of the [Media Design Master](https://www.hesge.ch/head/en/programs-research/master-arts-media-design) program of the [HEAD – Genève](http://head-geneve.ch).

A selection of these projects will be exhibited in May 2024.
